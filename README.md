# Jupyter Notebook

Some examples using Iris dataset.

## Notebooks

* [Python IRIS Dataset](./python-example.ipynb)
* [Python Widgets](./widgets-example.ipynb)
* [R](./r-example.ipynb)

## Render Jupyter Notebook as PDF

The method used here is to render a PDF from LaTeX. The [Makefile](./Makefile)
describes how this is done. Call [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
with:

```bash
make python-example.pdf
```

## Google Colaboratory

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) is a
free online Jupyter notebook environment. It runs entirely in the cloud, so is a
good external test for your notebooks. It also integrates with documents on
Google Drive. See [here](https://github.com/burnash/gspread) for an example on
how to read from a spreadsheet.
